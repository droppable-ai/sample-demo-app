# Droppable Sample Demo App

A sample React + TypeScript + Vite application designed to showcase Droppable's AI-powered development features. This demo app provides an easy way to test Droppable without connecting your own GitHub repository.

## 🚀 What is Droppable?

Droppable is an AI-powered development assistant that combines environment management with an intelligent browser widget for real-time code modifications. You can interact with your code using natural language through Claude AI integration.

## ✨ Features of This Demo

- **React + TypeScript + Vite** - Modern frontend development stack
- **Pre-configured Widget** - Droppable widget ready for AI interactions
- **Sample UI Components** - Components ready for AI-powered modifications
- **Easy Deployment** - One-click environment creation in Droppable dashboard
